- [ ] one bash file that does the whole downloading and installing setup
- [ ] create new files: 
  - [ ] train script
  - [ ] play script with controller
  - [ ] ppo implementation + actorcritic
  - [ ] environment
- [ ] test speed
  - [x] iterations w/o actnet - same, so it's not AN
  - [x] iterations w/ actnet - 55,052 steps/s - stabilize to 49,410 steps/s
  - [x] test old codebase --> starts slower but then gets faster
  - [x] diff of settings
    - why are obs 45 and 46?
    - terrain 10x10 vs 4x4?
    - terrain proportions -> fewer and weird?
    - randomize_lag_timesteps?
    - add collapse_fixed_joints = True
    - add replace_cylinder_with_capsule = (
            True  # replace collision cylinders with capsules, leads to faster/more stable simulation
        )
    - density and damping are weird in PF (under asset)
  - [x] diff of base
  - [ ] diff of leggedgym - candidates
    - asset params
    - time buffer
    - rewards
    - domain rand
    - logging
    - terrain?
  - [x] diff URDF
  - [x] create hydra template
  - [x] merge configs
  - [x] merge base and env
  - [x] copy over rl stuff
  - [ ] performance
  - [ ] simplify code (take out optional stuff)
  - [ ] simplify settings
  - [ ] change entity in wandb to be loaded from external file
